Here be scripts for downloading Me.com.

Before you run these scripts, you should install wget-warc.
The easiest way to do this is by running

./get-wget-warc.sh

this will download and compile wget-warc and copy the executable
to the current directory.


All-in-one:
 ./dld-user.sh ${USERNAME}

Single:
 WGET_WARC=./wget-warc ./dld-public-me-com.sh ${USERNAME}
 WGET_WARC=./wget-warc ./dld-gallery-me-com.py ${USERNAME}
 WGET_WARC=./wget-warc ./dld-web-me-com.sh ${USERNAME}
 WGET_WARC=./wget-warc ./dld-homepage-mac-com.sh ${USERNAME}
